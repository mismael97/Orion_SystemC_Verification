This is a placeholder for app_icon.ico

To add your Windows ICO icon:
1. Create or obtain a .ico file with multiple sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256)
2. Use an online converter like https://www.icoconverter.com/
3. Save it as "app_icon.ico" in this directory
4. Delete this placeholder file
5. Rebuild the project

For now, the SVG icon (app_icon.svg) will be used.
